I created this project only to develop my Rust programming skills. I tried to learn Rust idioms. And i think i managed to do it(a little). I understand that my code has many flaws(example: i still haven't finished processing Result correctly).

Filer is a simple utility for navigating through files: it cannot delete, rename, or move files. Don't treat this as a serious project. However, I welcome criticism and suggestions for improving the code.

  
Important! The utility works correctly only on Linux.
